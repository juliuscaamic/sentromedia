# Simple Twitter feed for Silverstripe

This module puts a simple twitter feed into your page. Nothing fancy!

## Credits and Authors

 * Damian Mooyman - <https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-twitter>

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe 3.1 or above
 * PHP 5.3

## Installation Instructions

 * Extract all files into the 'twitter' folder under your Silverstripe root, or install using composer

```bash
composer require "tractorcow/silverstripe-twitter" "3.1.*@dev"
```

 * Run a dev/build to generate the required fields
 * Signup for a twitter app at https://dev.twitter.com/apps and create an access token. Go
   to the "Settings" tab in the CMS and load both the Consumer keys and the access token keys
   into the 'Twitter App' tab.
 * Put an `<% include TwitterWidget %>` into your template, or you can use the following to
   create a list of items.

```html
<% if LatestTweets %>
	<ul class="Tweets">
		<% loop LatestTweets %>
			<li class="Tweet">
				<label>
					<a href="http://www.twitter.com/{$User}" target="_blank" class="User">@$User</a>
					$DateObject.format('d F Y')
				</label>
				<p>$Content</p>
			</li>
		<% end_loop %>
	</ul>
<% end_if %>
```

## Templating

Tweets can be retrieved with one of the following controller functions (inside a loop or control)

 * $LatestTweets('10') - Returns up to the specified number of tweets (defaults to 10 if no count specified)
 * $LatestTweet - Returns the latest tweet
 * $Favorite('4') - Returns up to the specified number of favorite tweets (defaults to 4 if no count specified)

Each tweet object has the following properties:

 * ID - Twitter ID of the tweet
 * Date - Creation date (string value)
 * TimeAgo - Tweet age (string value)
 * DateObject - SS_DateTime instance containing Date value
 * User - Username of poster
 * Name - Real name of poster
 * Content - Tweet HTML
 * Link - Link to tweet
 * AvatarUrl - Link to poster's Avatar
 * ProfileLink - Link to author profile
 * ReplyLink - Link to reply to this tweet
 * RetweetLink - Linke to retweet this tweet
 * FavouriteLink - Link to add this tweet to favourites
